## üéÆ About

GUILTY is a daily detective mystery game inspired by Wordle, but instead of guessing words, you're using logical deduction to identify criminals. Using information theory and pattern recognition, players analyze suspect traits to find the culprit before they escape.

### Why GUILTY?

- **Pure Logic**: Every puzzle can be solved through deduction alone
- **No Luck Required**: Information theory ensures optimal play is rewarded
- **Daily Challenge**: New mysteries every 12 hours (AM/PM EST)
- **Skill-Based**: Track whether you won through luck or perfect deduction

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Gameplay
- **üîç Pattern-Based Deduction**: Analyze trait patterns across 16 suspects
- **üé® Visual Feedback System**: 
  - üü© Green = Exact trait match
  - üü® Yellow = Adjacent trait value
  - ‚¨ú Gray = Different trait value
  - ‚ùì Unknown = Missing information
- **üìä Trait Spectrum Guide**: Visual representation of trait relationships
- **üí™ Three Difficulty Levels**:
  - Easy (8 guesses, 3 yellow clues, 15% missing info)
  - Medium (6 guesses, 2 yellow clues, 25% missing info)
  - Hard (4 guesses, 1 yellow clue, 35% missing info)

### Advanced Features
- **üß† Information Theory**: Calculates minimum guesses needed
- **üìà Confidence Meter**: Real-time tracking of deduction progress
- **‚è±Ô∏è Speed Timer**: Track your solving speed
- **üéØ Elimination System**: Mark suspects as innocent
- **üì± Fully Responsive**: Works on all devices

### Crime Scenarios
- The Museum Diamond Heist
- The Research Lab Data Theft
- The Secret Recipe Theft
- The Five-Star Poisoning
- More scenarios coming soon!

## üéØ How to Play

1. **Study the Initial Profile**
   - You're shown an innocent suspect's traits
   - Note which traits are green (match), yellow (close), or gray (different)

2. **Find the Pattern**
   - Look for other suspects who would produce the same color pattern
   - Multiple suspects will match initially

3. **Make Strategic Accusations**
   - Choose suspects that will eliminate the most possibilities
   - Use feedback to narrow down options

4. **Deduce the Culprit**
   - Find the guilty party before running out of guesses
   - Optimal play averages 3.5 guesses

### Strategy Tips
- Start with suspects having complete information
- Focus on yellow traits - they're your best clues
- Use the trait spectrum to understand relationships
- Eliminate suspects who can't match the pattern

## üßÆ Game Theory

GUILTY uses information theory to ensure puzzles require genuine deduction:

### Entropy Calculation
- Each guess reduces uncertainty about the culprit
- Optimal guesses maximize information gain
- AI agent validates puzzle difficulty

### Minimum Guesses Formula
```
Theoretical Minimum = log‚ÇÇ(viable suspects)
Adjusted Minimum = Theoretical + (Missing Info Penalty)
```

### Difficulty Calibration
- Target: 3.5 average guesses for optimal play
- Win rate: >95% with perfect strategy
- Lucky wins: <10% of victories

## üîß Developer Tools

Access developer mode from the main menu:

### Available Tools
1. **Show Culprit**: Reveals current puzzle solution
2. **Run AI Test**: Simulates 100 games with optimal play
3. **Analyze Puzzle**: Shows entropy and viable suspects
4. **Show Optimal Guess**: Recommends best next move

### AI Agent Metrics
```javascript
// Example output
AI Agent Results (100 games):
- Win rate: 96.0%
- Average guesses: 3.48
- Lucky wins: 8%
- Optimal wins: 42%
- Distribution: 1:2%, 2:12%, 3:28%, 4:34%, 5:20%
```
